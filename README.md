# teensy_project.1

Personal Project using Teensy 3.6 and a few sensors just to try out.


## Getting Started

Instruction: TBA
The codes are written to be used in Arduino IDE.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

## Sensors

* Temperature sensor(s): BME680 - temperature, humidity, barometric pressure and VOC gas sensors on a single chip
* Particle sensor: PMS5003
* GPS module: NEO-M8N

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Design/Circuit Diagram

## Resources
Under Construction

* [Temperature Sensor: BME680](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-bme680-humidity-temperature-barometic-pressure-voc-gas/overview) - Used to check the pin connections and arduino library
* [Particle Sensor: PMS5003](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3686) - Multiple websites/blogs are referenced. Most useful is simply the datasheet
* [GPS Module: NEO-M8N](https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/neo-m8-series) - TBA
