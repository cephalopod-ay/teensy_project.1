# teensy_project.1

Personal Project using Teensy 3.6 and a few sensors just to try out.


## Getting Started

Instruction: TBA
The codes are written to be used in Arduino IDE.

### Conditions

test_PMS5003_adafruit.ino, which is modified from the code I found on adafruit website - check the reference - seems fine, alghouth this code often gives me "checksum failure." But still working on writing my own code. 

This python code (https://github.com/dobra-dobra/Python_PMS5003/blob/master/pms5003.py) is conceptually pretty helpful in terms of what's to be done.

```
Give examples
```

## Sensors

* Temperature sensor(s): BME680 - temperature, humidity, barometric pressure and VOC gas sensors on a single chip
* Particle sensor: PMS5003
* GPS module: NEO-M8N

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example

### And coding style tests
